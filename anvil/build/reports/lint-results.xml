        id="OldTargetApi"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Target SDK attribute is not targeting latest version"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html as well as follow this guide:&#xA;https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk.html"

        message="A newer version of com.jfrog.bintray.gradle:gradle-bintray-plugin than 1.5 is available: 1.8.4"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="4"
        summary="Obsolete Gradle Dependency"
        explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."

        message="Do not place Android context classes in static fields; this is a memory leak (and also breaks Instant Run)"
        category="Performance"
        priority="6"
        summary="Static Field Leaks"
        explanation="A static field will leak contexts.&#xA;&#xA;Non-static inner classes have an implicit reference to their outer class. If that outer class is for example a `Fragment` or `Activity`, then this reference means that the long-running handler/loader/task will hold a reference to the activity which prevents it from getting garbage collected.&#xA;&#xA;Similarly, direct field references to activities and fragments from these longer running instances can cause leaks.&#xA;&#xA;ViewModel classes should never point to Views or non-application Contexts."

        category="Accessibility"
        priority="6"
        summary="Accessibility in Custom Views"
        explanation="If a `View` that overrides `onTouchEvent` or uses an `OnTouchListener` does not also implement `performClick` and call it when clicks are detected, the `View` may not handle accessibility actions properly. Logic handling the click actions should ideally be placed in `View#performClick` as some accessibility services invoke `performClick` when a click action should occur."

        summary="Using left/right instead of start/end attributes"
        explanation="Using `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#RIGHT` can lead to problems when a layout is rendered in locales where text flows from right to left. Use `Gravity#START` and `Gravity#END` instead. Similarly, in XML `gravity` and `layout_gravity` attributes, use `start` rather than `left`.&#xA;&#xA;For XML attributes such as paddingLeft and `layout_marginLeft`, use `paddingStart` and `layout_marginStart`. **NOTE**: If your `minSdkVersion` is less than 17, you should add **both** the older left/right attributes **as well as** the new start/right attributes. On older platforms, where RTL is not supported and the start/right attributes are unknown and therefore ignored, you need the older left/right attributes. There is a separate lint check which catches that type of error.&#xA;&#xA;(Note: For `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#START`, you can use these constants even when targeting older platforms, because the `start` bitmask is a superset of the `left` bitmask.
